nodeAnalyzer
============

A project to integrate a C++ analyzer with a node server for GRIFFIN &amp; TIGRESS.
Initial code shamelessly ripped off from examples at
http://nodejs.org/api/addons.html
and
http://howtonode.org/hello-node

After installing node, the simplest (and probably most useful) example is in callAbin.js.  Just start the server:

node callAbin.js

then visit the URL

http://localhost:8000/?command=a.out

with a.out replaced with your executable.  Output should appear in the bowser.

C++ wrapped in node
============

setup
============
In order to use/develop nodeAnalyzer with C++ wrapping, you'll need three things:

1. node: http://nodejs.org/
2. npm (node package manager): https://npmjs.org/
3. node-gyp: npm install -g node-gyp

use
============
The example C++ code lives in hello.cc.  Two methods called FirstMethod and SecondMethod are decalred, to show how to make a list of methods; binding.gyp contains the 'Makefile - like' directives for mashing these into the JavaScript.

To see it go, check the package out and in its root directory, do

node-gyp configure

node-gyp build

node hellowurld.js

Then go visit
http://localhost:8000/?fxn=hello&payload=wurld

to see the magics.
